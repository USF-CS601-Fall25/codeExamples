// Take a look at this example: why isn't the final count always 20000?
// This is NOT a visibility problem (volatile would not help).
// Itâ€™s an atomicity problem:
// Hint: count++ looks like one step, but it actually involves three operations:
// 1) read count, 2) add 1, 3) write count back.
// If threads interleave these steps, updates get lost.
